Projects Like

* Intrusion Detection System		            ( May-June 2014 )
Have implemented and tested Fast Adaptive Neural Network Classifier for Fast Signature Based Network Intrusion Detection System in Matlab.

* Implementation  Butterworth Filter in TI MSP430 Launchpad                     (April 2014)
Second order Butterworth Digital Filter is implemented in MSP430 Microcontroller and the filtered signal plotted in real-time.

* Portable ECG Machine with Real-time Data Processing.                    (Jan-March 2014 )
Protyped a portable ECG Machine involving Analog Integrated Circuits and Microcontroller to capture the ECG Signal from the heart and upload it to the webserver through a Handheld Mobile Device with Bluetooth.

* Classroom Face Attendance System with Principal Component Analysis in Matlab.
Developed a Attendance system based on face recognition by PCA algorithm.

* Autonomous Shortest Route Finding Robot based on Image Processing
Fabricated a bot which could reach a destination by finding the shortest track (in Matlab) that connects the maximum checkpoints and avoiding the mine points in a 6x4 grid.

* Wirelessly Accelerometer Controlled Bot.
Made a bot controlled by accelerometer wirelessly controlled by rf module by programming the avr(Atmega16) microcontroller.

* Controlled Angry Birds game with the Embedded System.
Accelerometer is used to control the angle of the bird with a stick and stretch is made by the stretch sensor this data is sampled and then send to the computer by TI MSP430 and this data is used to control the game using python

* Mouse Control using Opencv Image Processing.
Finger tracked by the opencv program is used to control the mouse using python.

* Paint application with Leap Motion device.
Hand Position data received from device is used to draw the desired figure in the application

* CRO using matplolib in python.
Voltage reading from any circuit is sampled using the ADC and send to the PC with a help of microcontroller and then graph is plotted dynamically.
